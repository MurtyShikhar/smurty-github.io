I am a first year CS PhD Student in the Stanford NLP Group, currently working with Prof. [Christoper Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/). My main research goal is in learning representations of language that facilitate [compositional/systematic generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12889), and then using these representations as tools for learning, reasoning and communication. Apart from that I'm interested in [program induction/semantic parsing](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1273.pdf), meta learning, [hierarchical representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06627) and [extracting information](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1010.pdf) from raw text.

### Bio

I started studying Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi because of interests in hacking electronics. Very soon, I realized I was way more interested in hacking code together and was fascinated by word2vec's famous "king - man + woman = queen" result, and so I started working on NLP with Prof. [Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/). Right after finishing undergrad, I moved to beautiful Amherst for a year long internship with Prof. [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/). Soon after that, I moved to Montreal to work on systematic generalization and program induction with Prof. [Aaron Courville](https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/). 


See [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ubAcojQAAAAJ&hl=en) for a list of publications.

When not working, things I like to do include fitness, reading and baking.
